# Connections

This Connection game project is implemented using Java, with inspiration from [New York Times Connection Puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections).

It is built for the Fundamentals of Computer Science II (Fundies II) course, with the given documentation of ImpWorld and the unique tester library. It uses the special big-bang 
syntax to run the program on the local desktop with dependency on mutable states, built-in world classes, and event handlers (mouse events, keyboard events).

## üéÆ GamePlay
* Upon running, the game will generate a 4x4 grid with words on each grid
* The goal is to select 4 words that belong to the same category
* There will be a hint informing the player that three of the four words are chosen correctly
* The game ends if the player either correctly organizes all 4 categories or uses all 4 tries
* After the game ends, the player can press 'R' to restart another round with different words

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works
* **java.awt.color** - Provides the color value and RGB
* **java.util.*** - Uses the ArrayList, Iterator, and Random to manage collections of words as well as to randomize each set of 16 words
* **javalib.impworld** - Provides the global world states, such as **World**, **bigBang**, and **Event Handlers** to exeucte the program as well as handle user interactions
* **javalib.worldimages** - Provides world images for component rendering such as RectangleImage, TextImage,...

## ‚öôÔ∏è To run the game locally
* In terminal:
   * javac -cp lib/javalib.jar src/*.java
   * java -cp lib/javalib.jar:src App
